# Cross-compile a JUCE VST3 for Windows from Linux, verify it actually loads
# under Wine, and package it into dist/ — no GitHub Actions minutes spent.
#
# Usage:
#   build-windows.sh <PluginTargetName> [repo_root]
#
# <PluginTargetName> is the juce_add_plugin target (the VST3 target is
# "<Name>_VST3" and the artefact dir is "<Name>_artefacts"). repo_root defaults
# to the current directory.
#
# Requires: cmake, g++-mingw-w64-x86-64-posix, wine, zip. The toolchain file
# (cmake/toolchain-mingw64.cmake) and the mingw-compat shim must be in the repo
# (copy them from this skill's assets/ if the project doesn't have them yet).
